## [1.0.9]

- minor "fix" for pivot support when doing a rotation in 3d (still missing proper transforms)
- added [GPoint.multiply]
- added Support for variable fonts in [GIcon] with [GlyphVariation].
- added [GKeyboard.anyDown] and [KeyboardEventData.any]
- added [Graphics.beginPaint] to add raw Paint() instances in graphics.

  complementary [graphics.beginShader] and [graphics.lineShaderStyle] and the
  utility [ResourceLoader.loadShader] to load the FragmentProgram from assets.
- added [graphics.blendMode()] to assign a [BlendMode] to the current drawing fill (or stroke).
- new [ColorfulShaders] example to demonstrate the new features.

- small fixes in demos and signal mapping in mouse event.
- `OutlineFilter(width, color)` to create a border around the target object.
- separate base_filter from blur_filter file for cleanup.
- added `currentObject` to GBaseFilter, so the filters can access transformation data from the
  DisplayObject (like OutlineFilter).
- added `DisplayObject::onPreTransform` signal that runs at the beginning of the rendering (before
  any filter, mask or transformation is applied).
- expose `stage!.controller.pointer.lastEvent` getter to read last mouse/touch event independently

- changed all methods that takes `int` hex colors + alphas, to `Color` (beginFill,
  beginGradientFill, stage.color, etc).
- fix `trace` for web and `dartpad` output.
- renamed most common classes (that do not start with **G**) to follow a **G**Name pattern.
    - SimpleText > GText
    - GxIcon > GIcon
    - Sprite > GSprite
    - GxPoint > GPoint, and so on...
- added dispose() to `KeyboardManager` and `PointerManager`... so it manages hot reloader better.
- added `LayoutUtils.objectFit()` to resize `GDisplayObject` (specially Bitmaps), using BoxFit.
- downgraded `flutter_svg` to 0.18.1 in "example" to make it usable in beta channel.
- refactor resource_loader.dart, changed most methods to use named params, now only stores in cache
  if a `cacheId` is defined (and also returns the cached data).

  dartpad).

## [0.9.7]

- added `MovieClip.gotoAndPlay` lastFrame for animation.
- exposed the `GifAtlas::textureFrames` so they can be used in MovieClips.
- added several methods from Flutters Path in `Graphics`... (conicCurveTo(), arcToPoint(), arc())
  with some new optional parameters for relative drawing.
- added new signals for `stage.onMouseEnter`, `stage.onMouseLeave` to detect touch positions when it
  leaves the Widget area... ( useful for scene with buttons).

## [0.9.6+2]

- change `flutter_svg` version to be compatible with stable branch.

## [0.9.6]

- Improved docs.
- Removed animations.dart, GTween is used in favor of Juggler.
- Changed [GameUtils] to [Math], class to keep consistency with ActionScript/JS API.
- Improved gradient support in `Graphics`. For the sake of representing all the options for
  different Gradient Shaders in GraphX, uncommon positional parameters where replaced by named
  parameters for `lineGradientStyle()` and `beginGradientFill()`.
- Fixed a bug with [StaticText.width] when using by default `double.infinity`, unsupported in
  Flutter web non-SKIA target.
- Minor bugfixes.
- Added package `http` and `flutter_svg` dependencies to facilitate some GraphX features.
- Added [SvgUtils] with basic methods to work with svg data.
- Renamed [AssetsLoader] to [ResourceLoader], and moved to the `io` namespace; to avoid confusion
  with Flutter concepts where asset reference a local resource.
- Added [NetworkImageLoader] class, to provide the ability to load remote images. Can be used
  with [ResourceLoader.loadNetworkTexture] and [ResourceLoader.loadNetworkSvg]. WARNING: no CORS
  workaround for web targets.
- Added cache capabilities to network images, and some new methods on [ResourceLoader]:
  loadNetworkSvg(), loadNetworkTexture(), loadSvg(), getSvgData().
- Added [StaticText.build()] to simplify the initialization and styling of [StaticText].
- Added [Keyboard], utility class to simplify interactions with `stage.keyboard` during `update()`
  phase [stage.onEnterFrame].

## [0.9.5]

- Fixes `DisplayObject.visible` not being updated on rendering.
- Added `display object.setProps()` as a shortcut to assign basic properties using GTween and
  immediate render.
- Added `GlowFilter`, `DropShadowFilter` and `ColorMatrixFilter`.
- Added `GTween` extension support to filters, can easily create tweens like:
  ```dart
  var glow = GlowFilter(4, 4, Colors.blue);
  box.filters = [glow];
  stage.onMouseDown.add((event) {
  glow.tween(duration: .3, blurX: 12, color: Colors.green);
  });
  stage.onMouseUp.add((event) {
  glow.tween(duration: .3, blurX: 4, color: Colors.blue);
  });
  ```
- Added `SystemUtils.usingSkia` to restrict unsoported operations in regular Flutter web.
- Fixed `GTween.overwrite=1` so it finds the proper target object.

## [0.9.4]

- fixes TextureAtlas XML parsing (some formarts were not readed properly).
- added support for hot-reload: Now you can use `SceneConfig.rebuildOnHotReload`
  and `stage.onHotReload` to manage your own logic.
- fixed some issues with dispose() not cleaning up vars (useful for hotReload).
- added SceneController access to the stage (`stage.controller`).
- Basic support for Flutter Web (no SKIA target needed!), will have to check all the APIs.
  New `SystemUtils.usingSkia` to check the compilation.

## [0.9.2] - [0.9.3]

- added `SceneController::resolveWindowsBounds()` to get a GxRect in global coordinates, to
  calculate the screen offsets between GraphX scenes and other Widgets at different locations in the
  Widget tree.
- StaticText now listens to systemFonts, to detect when fonts loaded at runtime (useful when using
  GoogleFonts package).

## [0.9.1]

- GxIcon recreates `ParagraphBuilder` on each style change (otherwise throws an exception in latest
  builds with web-skia in dev channel).
- each DisplayObject has its own Painter now for `saveLayer`, the bounding rect can't be skipped
  by `$useSaveLayerBounds=true`.

## [0.9.0]

- GraphX moves to RC1!
- new `maskRect` and `maskRectInverted` as an alternative to `mask` for masking DisplayObjects but
  makes scissor clipping with `GxRect`.
- added `GxMatrix.clone()`
- added `GTween.timeScale` to have a global control over tween times and delays.
- added `Graphics.beginBitmapFill` and `Graphics.lineBitmapStyle` to Graphics, now you can fill
  shapes with Images!
- improved `Graphics.beginGradientFill` for `GradientType.radial`... now you can specify
  the `radius` for it.
- added support `Graphics.drawTriangles()`, (uses `Canvas.drawVertices()`), to create potentially 3d
  shapes. Supports solid fills: image, gradient, and color, but no strokes (`lineStyle`).
- flipped CHANGELOG.md versions direction.
- more code cleanup and updated README.md!

## [0.0.1+9]

- readme fix.

## [0.0.1+8]

- big refactor to initialize SceneController(), now it takes the [SceneConfig] from the
  constructor (`withLayers()` was removed).

  happens too fast over the target.
- an improved README.md

## [0.0.1+6]

## [0.0.1+4]

- code clean up and minor fixes in the readme.
- adds `trace()` global function, as an option to `print()`. It allows you to pass up to 10
  arguments,
  and configure stack information to show through `traceConfig()`. So it can print _caller_ name (
  method name),
  _caller object_ (instance / class name where caller is), filename and line number with some custom
  format.

## [0.0.1+3]

- Another improve to the README.md, gifs have links to videos, to check screencasts in better
  quality.
